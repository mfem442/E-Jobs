# E-Jobs
This web application is meant to simplify the connection between people looking for job opportunities and recruiters in IT areas.
It is developed using Express and React, which are both being administered by NPM.
The data of this application is stored in a MySQL database that contains all the information regarding the applicants and recruiters.

This web application was developed as part of the "Construcción de Software y toma de decisiones" course, which belongs to the study plan of Computer Technology Engineering in the Tecnológico de Monterrey.

A demo of the app can be seen [here](https://youtu.be/RlvABz4kDdM).
